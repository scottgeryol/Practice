# puts "Your word in all CAPS is: #{word.upcase}"

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# puts "please enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp
# if number.to_i > 100
#   puts "That's a big number"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.
# puts "please enter two numbers"
# number_1 = gets.chomp
# numnber_2 = gets.chomp
# puts "your total is: "
# puts number_1.to_i + numnber_2.to_i

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.
# puts "please enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
# puts "please enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp
# by_10 = (number.to_i * 10)
# puts "Your number multiplied by 10 is #{number.to_i * 10}"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
# puts "please enter two words"
# word_1 = gets.chomp
# word_2 = gets.chomp
# puts "#{word_1.upcase} #{word_2.upcase}"

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# number = gets.chomp
# if number.to_i < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number"
