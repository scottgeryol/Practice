# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first_name = "Scott"
# last_name = "Geryol"

# puts first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "Scott"
# last_name = "Geryol"

# puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# puts "Input a word: "

# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# else
#   puts "Try again"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# sky = "blue"
# ocean = "clear"
# grass = "green"

# puts "I can't believe how " + ocean + " the ocean water is and " + sky + " the sky is against the very " + grass + " grass!"

# sky = "blue"
# ocean = "clear"
# grass = "green"

# puts "I can't believe how #{ocean} the ocean water is and #{sky} the sky is against the very #{grass} grass!"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# puts "Please ense a name: "
# name = gets.chomp
# if name != "Santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# title = "Hatchet"
# author = "Me"

# puts "My favorite book is " + title + " by " + author + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# title = "Hatchet"
# author = "Me"

# puts "My favorite book is #{title} by #{author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# puts "Please enter your password: "

# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   puts "Shall we play a game?"

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city1 = "Chicago "
# city2 = "Maui"
# city3 = "Palm Springs"

# puts "I live in " + city1 + "and just went to " + city2 + " but am leaving for vacation in " + city3 + " soon!"
